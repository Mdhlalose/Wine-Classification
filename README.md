# Wine-Classification

I used the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier models for this wine classification task.
The Wine dataset consisted of classes labeled 1, 2, and 3.
The dataset also consisted of thirteen features which included: Alcohol, Malic.acid, Ash, Acl, Mg, Phenols, C, Nonflavanoid.phenols, Proanth, Color.int, Hue, OD, Proline.
I performed Exploratory Data Analysis, then Data Preprocessing and lastly Modelled the data.
